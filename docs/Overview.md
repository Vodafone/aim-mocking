# AIM - Vodafone mocking service

---

AIM in short is an express based mocking middleware capable of mocking and recording APIs.

The main benefit of using aim over other tools is that AIM does not need mapping files or written code to map your request and serve back the mock files - which leads to **much lower maintenance cost**.
